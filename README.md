# version-control-system-mygit-
This project involved designing and implementing a simplified version control system that mimics Git's core object model and workflow. The system was built using C++ and utilized the SHA-1 algorithm for content addressing and data integrity, and a compression algorithm (zlib) for efficient object storage.
